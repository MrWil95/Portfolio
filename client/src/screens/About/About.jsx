            <p className='about2info'>Ever since I was a kid Iâ€™ve always taken an interest in drawing & designing my own creations. As I got older I moved my focus from pad & paper to digital media. Teaching myself how to use software like Krita, Blender, and Photoshop, I can create beautiful logos that will enhance the visual quality of your brand. I can also make stunning 3D models to use in your projects.</p>
